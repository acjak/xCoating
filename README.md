# xCoating

Software to calculate optimal geometry and best optical coatings for a Wolter I x-ray telescope.

The software requires an installation of IDL with IMD from http://www.rxollc.com/idl/ along with Python. The codebase is at this point very messy and only uses a single core on the computer when running.
